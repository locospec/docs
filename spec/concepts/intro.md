# Intro

Developing web and mobile apps doesn't force engineering or product teams to reach out to typical Data Structures and Algorithms. The typical flow of making a HTTP Request to backend, and somehow handle it, and respond - just works. But it also brings lack of standard - we end-up building the same solutions over and over again. Though the solution can be reused via packaging, it's not standardized.

In order to make it standardized, LoCoSpec reaches out to some of computer science data structures and algorithms. We don't need in-depth knowledge or using complex ADTs, or Algorithms.

In "Concepts" section we attempt to educate ourselves with basics, and then realize that we can build a lot of things with them pretty neatly.

## State Machines

Everything which has a "logical flow" (workflow) can be represented as a State Machine. Before we delve into State Machines, we explore Graphs as a Data Structure, and build a State Machine as a followup.
